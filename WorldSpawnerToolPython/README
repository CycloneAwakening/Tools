SWGEmu World Spawner Tool Python
=============================

This is a tool to control the various regions on each planet. It is written in Python 3 and requires the following packages to be installed on Linux:
- python3-tk
- python3-pip
After that you need to pip install lupa and Pillow.
Windows only needs the pip install lupa and Pillow since default Python is delivered with both pip and tk.

Features
--------
 * Shows each planet and their defined regions.
 * Shows the settings for each region.
 * Allows the user to modify the settings for the regions (any change is automatically saved).

Limitations
-----------
 * The user has to ensure that the prerequisites are installed.
 * Can only be run from the WorldSpawnerToolPython directory currently.
 * Hard coded paths taken from the Zonama dev environment.
 * Only existing spawn groups can be used. Spawn groups are taken from the Core3 repo that is checked out.

 Install Prerequisites
 ---------------------
 Do:
 - sudo apt-get install python3-pip
 - sudo apt-get install python3-tk
 - python3 -m pip install lupa Pillow
